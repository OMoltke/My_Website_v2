title: Investigating the economic feasibility of energy storage
---

In my bachelor thesis, my bachelor buddy and I investigated the economic feasibility of integrating grid-scale energy storage with utility-scale solar PV plants. To do our study, we needed to process large amounts of data - more specifically, 7 years worth of hourly observations of electricity prices - and conduct monte carlo simulations on this data. We did this using the software, Crystal Ball, in MS Excel. After our course in Data Analytics for Finance, I am sure that we could have conducted this analysis much quicker, had we been proficient in R. However, here, I will take you through our approach and reflect on the potential applications of R in this context.

### Abstract:
*In this paper, we develop a generic model to assess the economic feasibility of integrating grid-scale energy storage with intermittent energy sources. The paper concludes a positive impact on the financial return on investments by integrating a flywheel energy storage solution in utility-scale solar PV based on a case study in Northern Europe. We identify and evaluate three different revenue streams of solar PV with energy storage:*

- *(I) overpowering capacity*
- *(II) energy trading, and* 
- *(III) reserve capacity.*

*Our findings show that the individual revenue streams are insufficient to cover the initial investment cost. Current studies on energy storage are limited, as they do not consider the possibility of operating all the revenue streams at the same time. Our findings contradict previous research indicating that participation in the reserve capacity market (III) is essential for the economic feasibility of energy storage. We conclude that a positive NPV is achievable through revenue stream (I) and (II) together. However, in support of the research, we find that participation in the reserve capacity market (III) significantly increases investment returns. We investigate the excess energy production of solar PV plants and how to utilise it to expand total energy output (I). To evaluate energy trading (II), we model the stochastic behaviour of electricity prices through a deterministic Markov chain of Generalised Wiener Processes observed in discrete states. Using the drift and variance obtained from historical electricity price data, we simulate the electricity price fluctuations and energy trading using Monte Carlo simulations with a built-in real option.*

## Deployment of energy storage in connection with intermittent energy sources

A few concepts need to be understood in order to progress. 

### Pricing and price development of electricity

First, the pricing of electricity is determined by marginal cost of production for different sources and required energy, as shown below.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/powerpricing.JPG",error =FALSE)
```

Thus, as in any other market, the price is driven by supply and demand. The special thing about the electricity market is the full commoditisation of the product, while the production methods vary significantly in both input and processes. 

After pulling hourly price data from the European electricity market, [*Nordpool*](https://www.nordpoolgroup.com/), we found an expected pattern in price development throughout the day.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/historicalpricecurve.JPG",error =FALSE)
```

### Utilisation of energy storage: Excess production

Our first revenue stream to utilise was the **excess production from overpowering**. Due to the low cost of solar panels, scarcity of grid connection, and daily change in production, developers are increasingly *overpowering* their solar parks in order to utilise the grid connection as much as possible. This is shown below.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/overpoweringnostorage.JPG",error =FALSE)
```

Due to the seasonal change in solar irradiation in non-equatorial regions the utilisation of grid connection and excess production changes dramatically in summer and winter.

By connecting energy storage to these production plants, we are able to capture the excess production and feed it onto the grid when the production curve dips below the max grid capacity. This is shown below as *additional output*.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/overpoweringwstorage.JPG",error =FALSE)
```

Thus the explanation of the first revenue stream: **utilisation of excess production**.

### Utilisation of energy storage: Energy trading

The electricity price fluctuates daily due to changes in supply and demand. As of today, large amounts of electricity cannot be stored. Thus, the urgency factor of electricity is instantaneous. Should one be able to time-shift electricity from one price-area to another, that person would be able to arbitrage on this difference. Since the electricity price, in general, follows a daily pattern, this may be structured as shown below.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/energytrading.JPG",error =FALSE)
```

By buying in the low-price environment and selling in a high-price environment, it is possible to profit from this difference. One could rightly argue that as soon as storage technologies are feasible, this opportunity will be cannibalised. This is true. However, as intermittent energy sources increase their share in the energy mix, supply and demand mis-matches are expected to increase, increasing this arbitrage opportunity.

### Utilisation of energy storage: Reserve capacity

Our third and final revenue stream derived from **offering the energy storage as reserve capacity in the market**. By doing this, regulators of the energy grid gain access to dispatch the energy units in order to stabilise the overall grid as the planned production never meets exactly the actual demand. We found that this had high fees and was an opportunity to drive profits. However, it restricted some storage capacity to use for the other two revenue streams. This dynamic is shown below:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/reservecapacity.JPG",error =FALSE)
```

### Utilisation of energy storage: Revenue stacking

It is worth noting the large proportion of idleness in energy storage in each of these three separate scenarios. Both of the grid connection and of the storage capacity. To decrease idleness, we combined all three revenue streams, a concept known as **revenue stacking**.

By applying all three approaches at once, the below scenario can be outlined.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/revenuestacking.JPG",error =FALSE)
```

This is our final application method, and this was the mode of operation, which we tried to optimise by applying real options theory and conducting Monte Carlo simulations.

## Takeaways from working with R
Our specific data and outcome is unfortunately *confidential*, per the agreement with our two partner companies, solar developer [**BeGreen**](https://www.begreen.dk/en), and energy storage manufacturer [**WattsUp Power**](https://wattsuppower.com/). Thus, we will not dive further into the calculations. However, it would be interesting to revisit our approach using R. A great advantage of using R in this case, would be the ease of re-running the whole data set with updated data. To do this with our existing Excel-model, would require us to re-pull the raw data and conduct a significant amount of data wrangling before being able to re-run the Monte Carlo Simulations. 

Thus, before working with large amounts of data in the future, I would think twice and consider, whether it would be better to do it with R.
