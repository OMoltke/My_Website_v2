# Moon Panda

My brother, Gustav, and his wife, Maddy, have a band together. The band is called [**Moon Panda**](https://www.facebook.com/MoonPandaMusic/).

Maddy is from *San Diego, California* and Gustav is from *Haslev, Denmark*. They met at [Berklee College of Music](https://www.berklee.edu/) in Boston, USA, where they both studied their undergraduate. Now, they are married, live in Denmark, and have a dog named BMO.
