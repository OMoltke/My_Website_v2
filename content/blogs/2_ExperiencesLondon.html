<h1>Making friendships while making a difference</h1>
<p>On Friday the 3rd of September, Stream B of the MFA 2022 went to help the <a href="https://splashprojects.com/">Splash Projects</a> rebuild an old playground as well as tidy up some gardening areas.</p>
<p>This was a great opportunity to meet our new fellow students while making a positive impact and get some physical work in. My group, specifically, was group B4.</p>
<p>The work was carried out in <strong>Swedenborg Gardens</strong>, London, which you can see on the map below.</p>

<h2>Group B4</h2>
<p>It was the first time, I was going to meet my study group, group B4.</p>
<p>The group consists of <strong>Daria</strong> from Russia, <strong>Leilah</strong> from the UK, <strong>Yuna</strong> from China, <strong>Martin</strong> from Bulgaria, <strong>Allen</strong> from China, <strong>Neel</strong> from India, and myself, <strong>Otto</strong>, from Denmark. So we are a very diverse group.</p>
<p>Finally, if you are fortunate enough to have access to our Canvas, you will be able to see the recap video from the day <a href="https://learning.london.edu/courses/6956/pages/mfa2022-away-day">HERE</a>.</p>
