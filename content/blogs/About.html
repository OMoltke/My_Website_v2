<p>My name is Otto Moltke, I am 24 years old, and I come from Denmark.</p>
<p>I am currently studying my master’s in Financial Analysis at London Business School.</p>
<p>Before moving to London, I lived in Copenhagen for four years. Here, I did my undergraduate degree at <a href="https://www.cbs.dk/en">Copenhagen Business School</a> in <a href="https://www.cbs.dk/en/study/bachelor/bsc-in-international-business">International Business</a>.</p>
<p>During my undergraduate degree, I learned about a wide range of topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Accounting</li>
<li>Finance</li>
<li>Strategy</li>
</ul>
<p>After finishing my bachelor’s thesis, I started working in the Danish energy company, <a href="https://orsted.co.uk/">Ørsted</a>, which specialises offshore wind. Here, I worked in their Offshore Strategy department. I was lucky to get the opportunity to work there full-time for a full year. During my time here, I got to improve my skills in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project management</li>
<li>Structure problem-solving</li>
<li>Powerpoint</li>
</ul>
<p>After my master’s degree, I hope to work with energy once again.</p>
<p>In my spare time in London, I enjoy:</p>
<ul>
<li>going to pub quizzes at <a href="https://www.barleymowlondon.co.uk/">The Barley Mow</a> with my friends</li>
<li>going for runs in Regent’s Park or a swim in LBS’ gym facilities</li>
<li>playing rugby with LBS’ rugby club</li>
<li>playing tennis in Regent’s Park</li>
<li>Doing homework in R for my Data Analytics Course.</li>
</ul>
<p>Back home, I enjoyed going for bike rides around my local neighbourhood with my friends - both gravel and road biking. Over here, however, I am sure that the combination of the traffic of London with my inability to get used to cars driving in the left side of the road would not make bike riding enjoyable.</p>
<p>That’s all for now.</p>
<p>I hope that you enjoy browsing around my website, and that you find something of interest.</p>

<p>Best,
