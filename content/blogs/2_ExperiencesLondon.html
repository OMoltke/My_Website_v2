<h1>Making friendships while making a difference</h1>
<p>On Friday the 3rd of September, Stream B of the MFA 2022 went to help the <a href="https://splashprojects.com/">Splash Projects</a> rebuild an old playground as well as tidy up some gardening areas.</p>
<p>This was a great opportunity to meet our new fellow students while making a positive impact and get some physical work in. My group, specifically, was group B4.</p>
<p>The work was carried out in <strong>Swedenborg Gardens</strong>, London, which you can see at the blue dot on the map below.</p>

<div id="group-b4" class="section level2">
<h2>Group B4</h2>
<p>It was the first time, I was going to meet my study group, group B4.</p>
<p>The group consists of:
- <strong>Daria</strong> from Russia
- <strong>Leilah</strong> from the UK
- <strong>Yuna</strong> from China
- <strong>Martin</strong> from Bulgaria
- <strong>Allen</strong> from China
- <strong>Neel</strong> from India,
- and myself, <strong>Otto</strong>, from Denmark.</p>
<p>So we are a very diverse group.</p>

<div id="task-1-build-composte-containers" class="section level2">
<h2>Task 1: Build composte containers</h2>
<p>Our first task was to build compost containers for the locals to use. The containers were made of wood, which we cut out and mounted together.</p>
<p><img src="/img/CuttingWood.jpg" width="800px" /></p>
<p>After bulding the basic components of the containers, we carried them to place, where they were supposed to be used. Here, we finally mounted them together.</p>
<p><img src="/img/Moritz_ScrewdriverCasual.jpg" width="800px" /></p>
<p>As is shown by Mariana below, this required <strong>full</strong> concentration in order to make sure everything was aligned.</p>
<p><img src="/img/Mariana_Concentrated.jpg" width="800px" /></p>
<p>The final touch was the removable front piece, which had to be <em>hand cut</em> in order to make sure it fitted on the milimeter.</p>
<p><img src="/img/MoritzMartin_Sawing.jpg" width="800px" /></p>
<p>With pride, we could now step in to our newly built containers for a final group photo.</p>
<p><img src="/img/GroupPhoto_InCompost.JPG" width="800px" /></p>
<p>Here, we thought we were done. However, one last task remained - filling in the compost, which was lying in a big pile.</p>
<p>Moritz took lead, and he can be seen, posing proudly with the end result, below.</p>
<p><img src="/img/Moritz_Complete_Proud.jpg" width="800px" /></p>
<p>Thus, we were able to leave the site for lunch at the playground.</p>

<div id="task-2-gardening" class="section level2">
<h2>Task 2: Gardening</h2>
<p>In the afternoon, we worked with gardening. Here, one of our special tasks was to relocate a spiky bush. A process, which is documented below:</p>
<p><em>First, we needed to dig out the bush, without hurting its roots.</em></p>
<p><img src="/img/Plant_OutOfGround.jpg" width="800px" /></p>
<p><em>Then, carefully, we relocated the bush in a safe corner.</em></p>
<p><img src="/img/PlantPlanted_Above.jpg" width="800px" /></p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoy gardening, so although the afternoon was hard work, it was a nice experience.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, we were rewarded with two things.
First, we got an icecream from this great guy, whilst seeing the kids come in and start using the new features on the playground</p>
<p><img src="/img/PostWork_IceCream.jpg" width="800px" /></p>
<p>Second, we went to this great pub by the riverside and got a pint after a hard days work.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>Overall, we had a great day. We were able to make a positive difference in a challenged area, and we got to make new friendships and establish bonds inside and outside of our study groups.</p>
<p>Finally, if you are fortunate enough to have access to our Canvas, you will be able to see the recap video from the day <a href="https://learning.london.edu/courses/6956/pages/mfa2022-away-day">HERE</a>.</p>
